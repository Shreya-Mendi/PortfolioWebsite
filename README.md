# Shreya Mendi's Portfolio Website

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, Framer Motion, and Tailwind CSS. This portfolio showcases my work as a Machine Learning Engineer and AI Product Engineer, featuring my projects, work experience, skills, and professional background.

The portfolio uses Sanity CMS as a backend, enabling dynamic content updates without rebuilding the application. This architecture provides flexibility for keeping the portfolio up-to-date with latest projects and achievements.

## Updating Portfolio Content

To update the portfolio content (projects, work experience, skills, etc.), see the comprehensive guide in [SANITY_CONTENT_GUIDE.md](./SANITY_CONTENT_GUIDE.md). This guide includes all the resume information formatted for Sanity CMS.

# Next JS:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Running the code

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

# Vercel:

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
